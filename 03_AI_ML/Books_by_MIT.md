# WANT free books related to **AI** and **ML**?

MIT dropped their ENTIRE AI library for free and this is honestlyu the best resource you can use

Like... these are the exact books people pay thousands to access in grad school.
I've been going through them and had to share because this is actually insane.

## If you're just starting out:
- **Foundations of Machine Learning** - honestly, the clearest explanation of core algorithms I've seen. *Link*: https://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/mlbook/
- **Understanding Deep Learning** - they actually use visuals that make sense (finally!) *Link*: https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/
- **Machine Learning Systems** - this one's gold if you want to build stuff in production. *Link*: https://mlsysbook.ai/book/

## Getting more serious (Advanced):
- **Algorithms for ML** - breaks down the math in a way that doesn't make me want to cry *Link*: https://lnkd.in/g_85-xZs
- **Deep Learning** - It's dense, but it's THE book everyone references 
*Link*: https://www.deeplearningbook.org/

## Down the Reinforcement Learning track:
- **Reinforcement Learning - Sutton & Barto** - Everyone told me to read this. Now I get why. *Link*: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qYjI1igDuBg3x884JKZaCWuJkgdPylHN/view?pli=1
- **Multi-Agent Systems**- agents talking to each other? Competing? Fascinating stuff. *Link*: https://marl-book.com

## The stuff we need to talk about (Ethics & Probability):
- **Fairness in ML** - critical read. Shows you how to spot bias before it becomes a problem. *Link*: https://fairmlbook.org
- **Probabilistic ML (Part 1 & 2)** - not going to lie, still working through these. *Link*: https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html
